On my opponent’s turn they used the Protection ability of all 4 copies of Mouse Armor and chose Flounder all 4 times, giving it Resist 4. In this situation if my Beast- Relentless challenges that opposing Flounder, can I use Beast’s Second Wind ability to ready him?\r\n\r\nA: No, you cannot. If  a character with resist 4 is dealt 4 damage then all 4 damage is prevented by resist and therefore that character was not damaged."
