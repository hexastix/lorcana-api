In this situation if I quest with my The Queen- Commanding Presence and use her Who is the Fairest? Ability, what characters can I choose for each part of her effect?\r\n\r\nA: When using the Who is the Fairest? Ability of The Queen- Commanding Presence you must choose an opponent’s character to receive -4 strength. This means that you can only choose either Mickey Mouse or Maleficent to receive -4 strength in this example. When using the second part of the Who is the Fairest? Ability you may choose any character to receive +4 strength. In this example you may choose Mickey Mouse, Maleficent, The Queen or Flounder to receive +4 strength. Note that you must choose a character for each part of the ability so you are not able to decrease the strength of a character and not increase the strength of a character.\r\n"
