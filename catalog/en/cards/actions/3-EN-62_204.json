Can I still play Last-Ditch Effort and give my character Challenger +2 even though I can’t choose an opposing character?\r\nA: Yes. When there are no eligible opposing characters to choose for the first part of Last-Ditch Effort, that part of its effect simply finishes without exerting a character. However, the second part of its effect still happens, so you still choose a character of yours to get Challenger +2 until the end of the turn.\r\n"
