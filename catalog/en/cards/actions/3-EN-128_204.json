Can I play Divebomb and banish that Felicia to banish an opposing character with 5 {S} or less?\r\nA: Yes. The character you choose to banish with Divebomb’s effect must have less Strength than the character you banished with Divebomb had at the point they were banished. In this example, you could choose any opposing character with 5 {S} or less.\r\n"
